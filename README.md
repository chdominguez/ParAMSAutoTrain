# AutoTrain
AutoTrain is a small python program which connects with the more advanced ParAMS computational package. This program helps during the parametrization of ReaxFF forcefields.

# Features
AutoTrain has some features that make it appealing:
* Compact data storage: AutoTrain saves a unique file which contains all the necessary files for the PLAMS library to work: training_set, job_collection...
* Easy configuration: AutoTrain contains  tools to manage the configuration of optimizations.
* Restart: AutoTrain will save the optimization procedure at each iteration so it can restart it if there is an early stop.

# Requirements
* A valid installation of the [SCM](scm.com) package.
* A Debian based Linux distribution

# Installing
1. [Download](https://github.com/chdominguez/ParAMSAutoTrain/releases/download/1.5/autotrain_1.5-1_all.deb) the latest release
2. Install it with `sudo dpkg -i autotrain_1.5-1_all.deb`
3. Done!

# Usage
 `autotrain` justs starts the program normally. There you can access the training tools.

 `autotrain -h` shows help.
 
 `autotrain -i <input> -o <output>` starts training the force field with the configuration provided in the input json file. The logfile will be written in output.
